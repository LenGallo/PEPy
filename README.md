# PEPy: a tool for the analysis of Aparent Polar Wander Paths

This repository inclides the code used to generate the results presented in [An optimization method for Paleomagnetic Euler Pole analysis](https://eartharxiv.org/repository/view/2858/). We created synthetic data representing aparent polar wander paths than then we analyze in order to 1) fit segments of paleomagnetic poles that are generated by a single rotation arounf an Euler pole and 2) find the best sequence of segments and the corresponding change points for the full aparent polar wander path. These two analysis can be found in `EulerPole_optimization.ipynb` and `APWP.ipynb`, respectively.


## Installation 

The simples way to execute the code is using Binder. Simply go to the URL below and it will launch an interactive Python environment:

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/LenGallo/PEPy/HEAD)

You can also clone the repository in your local machine. We recommend you to use the `environment.yml` file to create a conda virtual environment for the project. Instructions of how to do this can be found in the [conda environment documentation](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html). 

After you have cloned the github repository in your machine, you can create the Python virtual environmnet by entering the following command in a terminal located in the direction of the repository
```
conda env create -f environment.yml
```
Next time you launched a Jupyter Notebook, you should see the option of opening it with the PEPy kernel. If this is not the case, you need to let Jupyter know that you want to use this environment’s kernel, by installing the environment’s ipykernel into Jupyter:
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name mytestenv --display-name "IPython - PEPy"

```
